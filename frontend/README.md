# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

-<div className='mt-auto'> in flex flex-col to push element to bottom of its container

inset-inline-end >Applies to positioned elements (like having top/bottom/left features or absolute themselves and relative parent)
 <inset-inline-end:0px;>
 sets the element to end in inline to its parent like float-right does ;

class <inset-y-0> means top:0; and bottom : 0; also can use <inset:1em;> means all 1em; t/b/l/r;
